# Foundry VTT Macros
Small collection of macros that I use for my games on FoundryVTT.

## Configuration
Scripts that I use to configure my Foundry in general, whether for mass editing things or more personalized stuff.

## General
Macros that I use in my quick action bar, mainly to speed up combat and manage different types of things quickly.

## Old
Old macros that still work but which I no longer use because I have no use for them at the moment.

## Resting
For my last game on 5e, I used a different rest system that I customized to my taste. The macros no longer work at all, but I keep them here as a souvenir.
